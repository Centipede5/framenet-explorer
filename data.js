The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.

'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .'

''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.'

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"the people\", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that \"forward\" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    'We went north . DNI'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  'Look left and you 'll see it . DNI '  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI' 'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.'  ''  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  '??? The book faced above the door .' vs. 'The book faced upward .'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by \"of\", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  '??? I faced east of the mountains .'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word \"to\".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like \"to the east\", as well as \"to both sides\" and \"to the rear\".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is \"potency\" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  '' 'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .'

Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). '' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called \"round\" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like \"about\", etc.   'Only two senators voted in support of the president .' 'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.' 'We endured forty days of snow .' 'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.' 'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI' 'The ship was three degrees off course .'  '' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. \"three hundred\".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without \"and\", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI' '' '' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  'There are just over six billion people in the world today.' 'There are just over six billion people in the world today.'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., \"3\" is a wordform of three.num). '' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties (\"A whopping three singers showed up\")  ''  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between \"six apples\" and \"six of the apples\".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that \"six of the apples\" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Some members of this frame indicate the plexity of the Ground, as either single-entity gestalt (inside), two-entity or bi-partite gestalt (between.prep), and multiple-entity or multipart gestalt (among.prep, amid.prep), while others are maximally general (in.prep).   ''  This frame makes use of the Bounded_region image schema, a way of partitioning a scene into an Interior, an Exterior, and a Boundary.  In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion (\"in a box\"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change (\"in the garden\").  The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.  'The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .' 'My keys were in the street .' 'Step back outside . CNI DNI ' 'She stood in a puddle and splashed desultorily .' 'I felt around inside the oven hood . CNI' 'They found the backpack and found a computer inside . DNI' 'Within the base , nobody knew the attack was about to hit .' 'We talked outside the office .' ''  This frame is intended to cover cases in which the Ground is a critical locus for the event.  (When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) 'The pole snapped off in her hand .' 'She combed her hair between her fingers .' ''  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: 'Inside my wallet is where i put it .' 'Outside your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .' ''  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: 'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI' '' ''  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  'Is the economy in recession ?' 'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI ' ''  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer's mind (construed as a Ground): 'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI' 'I felt an unease inside me .' 'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .' 'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .' ''  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): 'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .' 'There are so many children in the family .' ''  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: 'amid the confusion' 'inside the competition period' 'between lunch and dinner' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word \"period\") while others can take events as Grounds directly. ''  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): 'In the paper , `` self-control '' is used to mean a sense of willpower .' 'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep.

The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (\"a STRONG person\") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (\"a STRONG push\"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.'  'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.'  'A powerful force tore off the tree's branches.'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. ''  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: 'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.' 'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: 'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.' 'He was a forceful speaker.'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (\u201cSTRONGEST critics\u201d; \u201cMIGHTY uproar\u201d).  ''  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame's FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE's capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE's tendency. For example, \"a STRONG person\" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while \"an ENERGETIC person\" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - \"a STRONG push\" and \"an ENERGETIC push\" seem rather comparable.

Usually, the Consequence and Anti_consequence are also mutually exclusive, but in some cases (especially with \"even if\") the same Consequence results regardless of whether one considers the Profiled_possibility or the Opposite_possibility. Neither of the possibilities is asserted and neither can simply be merged with a factual understanding of the world. Both possibilities are presented as uncertain, and the Profiled_possibility may be further characterized with a neutral stance towards it, or with a doubtful, negative stance, depending on the specific lexical unit introducing the conditional and what verb forms are used in the Profiled_possibility. ''  'If you read caerfully, you 'll see the letters are swapped.' 'Unless you read carefully , you wo n't understand what I said .'  The most common use of lexical units connected to the Conditional_scenario is for prediction; in this case the conditionals pair up possibilities with predicted consequences. Subtypes of this use include, but are not limited to:  '' (1) contingencies:   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.'  (2) conditional promises (usually when making a deal): 'If you will wait with reasonable patience , I will explain'  (3) threats (which are inherently conditional):  'If any boy says anything to Weeks about it, I will cane him.'  (4) hypotheticals, especially when a different choice was made in the past and one imagines it would lead to a different outcome: 'If I had elected to stay there, I probably would not have become homeless five years later.'  (5) descriptions of general rules of the world: 'You only get shingles if you have had chickenpox.'  (6) descriptions of the characteristics of individual entities or persons that have an effect under certain circumstances: 'If Joey says you're in, you're in.'  '' Speech act conditionals: '' Lexical units of these frames can also be used in a pattern called a \"Speech Act conditional\".  In this case, the conditional presents a statement that is relevant to the conversation if the Profiled_possibility holds.   'Just ask for Bob if you need anything.'  The relevance of the statement is a Consequence of the Profiled_possibility, but there is no distinct alternative intended, so this usage does not normally allow distancing verb forms (see Dancygier and Sweetser 2005: 114-115). As shown in the above example, we annotate the potentially relevant statement as Consequence.  This is based on an analysis of the filler of the Consequence as metonymically expressing a message similar to \"it is relevant to say the following: ...\".  Such cases should be tagged with the clause-level tag \"Speech act\".  Thus in the following example, it is relevant for the speaker to explain the situation by saying \"no, she's not my wife\" if the other person is wondering about that possibility:  'In case you're wondering, no she's not my wife.' '' Metalinguistic conditionals: '' In addition, conditionals can be used to talk about the actual encoding of a message and usually encode a strong opinion about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of a description, often in contrast to someone else's contrary opinion. Such sentences should be tagged \"Metalinguistic\", as in the following:  'If that's not success, I don't know what is.' '' Epistemic conditionals: '' Finally, conditionals can be used to profile a reasoning process.  While all conditionals mark the connection from a hypothetical situation to an associated conclusion, many conditionals specifically highlight this process of thinking about the connection, especially when the reasoning is cooccurring with speaking, and most obviously when reasoning from effects to causes. In such cases as the following, we mark the clause as \"Epistemic\":  'If the lights are on, then somebody is home.'  Many sentences are vague about exactly to what degree they profile the reasoning process, so sentences like the following can be legitimately labeled \"Epistemic\" or not:  'If you believe that what you are doing is right then you can't compromise.'  '' Special constructions: '' Conditionals interact significantly with ellipsis constructions, particularly because they often occur in parallel structures in which different possibilities are being contrasted, or cases in which there is a contrast between what is always true and what is only conditionally true.  In these cases, the Profiled_possibility and the Consequence or Anti_consequence may be abbreviated under the same conditions that apply to ellipsis in the rest of the language.  See the following examples:  'She would visit for at least a week and, if necessary, an additional day or two.'  In these examples, \"an additional day or two\" is understood as \"she would stay an additional day or two\", based on the immediately preceding sentence.  This is a general construction that allows a finite sentence that is parallel to an immediately adjacent clause to be abbreviated just to the content in addition to or contrasting with the adjacent clause. Since it must be interpreted as a full clause and occurs in exactly the places a clause is expected, we actually annotate the PT of the Consequence as \"Sfin\" in these cases. The adjective \"necessary\" in the Profiled_possibility, however, is not licensed by a general construction that allows an adjective like necessary to be used arbitrarily in the kinds of places a clause would be found. Therefore, in this case, we consider the adjective to represent a separate valence with PT \"AP\".", "FE": [["Profiled_possibility", 16286, 1, "The situation presented explicitly as a possibility, contrasting with the implicit Opposite_possibility."], ["Consequence", 16288, 1, "The situation that follows from the Profiled_possibility."], ["Anti_consequence", 16289, 1, "The situation that follows as a result of the Opposite_possibility."], ["Opposite_possibility", 16287, 0, "The implicit situation that is mutually exclusive with the Profiled_possibility."]], "lexUnit": [], "frameRelations": [["Inheritance", "Child", "Parent", 2902, 2950], ["Inheritance", "Child", "Parent", 2910, 2902], ["Using", "Child", "Parent", 2902, 720], ["Using", "Child", "Parent", 217, 2902], ["See_also", "ReferringEntry", "MainEntry", 2902, 2991], ["Perspective_on", "Perspectivized", "Neutral", 2903, 2902], ["Perspective_on", "Perspectivized", "Neutral", 2904, 2902]]}, "2903": {"ID": 2903, "name": "Conditional_occurrence", "definition": "A Consequence is presented as occurring if the Profiled_possibility occurs.

'At least I don\u2019t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.)

'' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.

Identity persists across time and remains constant for an Instance despite arbitrary changes in other attributes of the Instance.  Establishing Identity answers the question \"which\".  'I still have questions about her identity .' 'Which dinner did you choose ?'  Identity is not the same as appearance or name (if the Instance even has such), although these attributes of the Instance may be useful in establishing Identity.  Identity can be established knowing the totality of the history of an Instance; however, this is impractical and usually proxies like name and appearance are used.  For the Identity of humans, history sufficient to establish Identity can usually be satisfactorily established by documents associated with the person, often with information like appearance and name, though use of such documents contributes to the problem of multiple identities, only one of which is considered legitimate or \"true\" in a given context.  Just as we would consider gun in \"fake gun\" to contain a reference to the normal concept of Weapon, we consider identity in \"multiple identities\" to belong to this frame, even if only one of the identities is legitimate.  Multiple identities can also exist when each is primarily associated with a fragment or aspect of the history and attributes of an entity, and the \"true\" identity might be very much debatable; in most such cases, there are different names associated with the different identities, as in the case of stage names or Ellis-Island names, but sometimes, the different \"identities\" go under the same name (e.g., some members of secret societies). While these may be considered different identities, they refer to the same person.

In this case, it is not individual identity of the physical hunk of metal that is intended to be in question, but rather the category that the hunk of metal fits into; i.e., the specific element or elemental composition of the metal is what is in question.

Identity can be established knowing the totality of the history of an Instance; however, this is impractical and usually proxies like name and appearance are used.  For the Identity of humans, history sufficient to establish Identity can usually be satisfactorily established by documents associated with the person, often with information like appearance and name, though use of such documents leads to the problem of multiple identities, only one of which is considered legitimate or \"true\" in a given context.
